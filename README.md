ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest backend project: a YouTube clone! ðŸŽ¥

I built this project using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. Some of the key features include:

MongoDB aggregate paginate and aggregation pipeline for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
JWT stateless authentication to ensure secure and scalable user authentication.
This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I owe a huge thanks to Mr. Hitesh Choudhary for his incredible guidance and resources. ðŸ™Œ

Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ’¬
